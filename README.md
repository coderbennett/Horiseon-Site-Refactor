This website features key items for an accessible webpage like Semantic HTML elements, alternative text for icons and images and logical structuring separate from visual elements like styling and positioning.

### Semantic HTML Elements

The site contains HTML elements such as &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt; to differentiate the content on the page clearly to all users. An example can be seen below as to how it looks within the HTML file:
